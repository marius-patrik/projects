# IDE Agent Configuration

This project uses a structured agent rules system located in the `agent/` folder. The IDE agent MUST follow these rules:

## Required Reading

**MANDATORY**: At the beginning of every coding session, the agent MUST read and understand:

1. **General Rules** (always apply):
   - `agent/RULES_GENERAL/RULES` - Fundamental rules for all projects
   - `agent/RULES_GENERAL/INSTRUCTIONS` - Detailed procedures and workflows
   - `agent/RULES_GENERAL/COMMANDS` - Command documentation

2. **Project-Specific Rules** (if they exist):
   - `agent/RULES_PROJECT/RULES` - Custom rules specific to this project
   - `agent/RULES_PROJECT/INSTRUCTIONS` - Custom instructions for this project
   - `agent/RULES_PROJECT/COMMANDS` - Custom commands for this project

3. **Project Documentation**:
   - `PROJECT.md` (or equivalent) - Project guidelines and standards
   - `README.md` - Project overview and structure
   - `TODO.md` - Current tasks and status

## File Analysis Rules

- **MANDATORY**: Read and analyze all files in the codebase at the start of every conversation
- **EXCEPTION**: Files in `agent/LIVE/` directory should be **IGNORED** during initial analysis (they are workspace-specific)
- All other files should be analyzed to understand the current state of the project

## Rule Application

- General rules from `agent/RULES_GENERAL/` are always applied
- Project-specific rules from `agent/RULES_PROJECT/` supplement general rules
- Project rules extend but do not replace general rules
- If project rules conflict with general rules, project rules take precedence for project-specific cases

## Session Initialization

Before starting any work, the agent MUST:

1. Read all general rules files
2. Read all project-specific rules files (if they exist)
3. Read project documentation (PROJECT.md, README.md, TODO.md)
4. Analyze the codebase structure
5. Establish context and understand current project state

## Command Handling

All commands are documented in `agent/RULES_GENERAL/COMMANDS` (and `agent/RULES_PROJECT/COMMANDS` if custom commands exist). The agent must:

- Support all documented commands
- Follow command specifications precisely
- Support alternative command formats (beginning or end of message)
- Handle command chaining appropriately

## Quality Assurance

After completing ANY task, the agent MUST:

1. Confirm implementation works as intended
2. Run lint and fix ALL issues
3. Run build and fix ALL errors
4. Test functionality and edge cases
5. Update todos and documentation
6. Mark tasks complete (✅) only after ALL checks pass

## Documentation

- Always update documentation when code changes
- Keep README files current and accurate
- Ensure documentation matches implementation
- Update todos as work progresses
